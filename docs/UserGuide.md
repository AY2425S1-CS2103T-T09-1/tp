* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>

**Q**: How do I add a new company with multiple tags? <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If running `java -jar internbuddy.jar` gives error**, such as terminal displaying an error, ensure that Java 17 or higher is installed. Run `java -version` to check your version. For Mac users, check if you have followed the advisory given [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html).
